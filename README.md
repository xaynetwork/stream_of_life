## Streams in Dart

### Native Streams

- Single vs Broadcast
- Stream for subscribing, Sink for adding events (combine as StreamController)

### Rx

- Why did I start out with RxDart?
- [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/ReactiveX) exists in many languages
- Subjects (Publish, Behavior, Replay) facilitate using Streams
- [Stream transformers](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart)

### Why use Streams?

- Great abstraction
- Extensive tooling for working with async
- Forces to approach a problem in a refreshing way
- Transformations and pure functions

### Hard to learn!

- Dart Streams are _different_ from Rx Observables unfortunately...
